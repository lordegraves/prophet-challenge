# Prophet Challenge

## Overview
This project leverages the Prophet time series forecasting model to predict future trends based on historical financial data. It demonstrates model fitting, forecasting, and visualization using Facebook Prophet and pandas. This project was completed as part of a Module 8 challenge.

## Files
- `M8_Starter_Code/` — Directory containing starter code and project files.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## Features
- Time series forecasting using the Prophet library.
- Loading and preparing time series data for model training.
- Generating future date predictions based on historical financial metrics.
- Visualizing predictions and forecast confidence intervals.
- Evaluating the model’s performance against observed data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas
- prophet
- matplotlib

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lordegraves/prophet-challenge.git
cd prophet-challenge
pip install pandas prophet matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `M8_Starter_Code` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Load the notebook and run the cells sequentially:
   - Load and prepare the dataset.
   - Fit the Prophet model.
   - Generate future forecasts.
   - Visualize predictions using the plotting tools provided.
4. Experiment by adjusting forecast periods, changepoint parameters, and seasonalities to observe changes in model behavior.
